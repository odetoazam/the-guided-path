  thesis:
    "A forty-six-ayah cross-examination that compresses the argument for resurrection into a single unanswerable question, sets the story of the greatest tyrant against the fate of a single soul, and then collapses the distance between now and the Day until a lifetime fits inside an afternoon.",

  heartVerse: {
    arabic: "وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِۦ وَنَهَى ٱلنَّفْسَ عَنِ ٱلْهَوَىٰ فَإِنَّ ٱلْجَنَّةَ هِىَ ٱلْمَأْوَىٰ",
    ayahRef: "79:40–41",
    translation: "But as for the one who feared standing before their Lord and restrained the self from desire — then the Garden is the refuge.",
    why: "The surah's complete ethical teaching compressed into two conditions: fear of the divine encounter and restraint of the desiring self. No list of prohibitions, no catalog of virtues — just these two. The person who carries the awareness that they will stand before God, and who holds the self back from what it craves, is the person An-Naziat identifies as saved.",
